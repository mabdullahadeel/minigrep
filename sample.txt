A language named Rust came to be,
Built for speed and safety, you'll see,
Its memory management, so sublime,
No more crashes, no more wasted time.

With ownership and borrowing rules,
Writing safe code is no longer a duel,
Its syntax clean and easy to learn,
Rust has shown its skills, and we all yearn.

For performance that's fast as a flash,
Rust is the language that won't crash,
A community that's helpful and bright,
Rust is a language that's taking flight.
